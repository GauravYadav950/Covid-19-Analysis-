📌 Overview


This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI to extract meaningful insights and visualize trends.
The workflow covers the entire data analytics lifecycle — from loading raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and transforming data, running SQL queries, and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills in a real-world dataset.
